L4.P1
A new set of numbers is added when the function add_numbers is called a second time.

L4.P4
Yes, the sort function worked.  A very easy way to test whether the sort function worked or not would be to use a for loop to test if the the
previous elements are less then the following elements. (e.g. f(n)?<f(n-1) )
